# quiz-platform
The Quiz Platform is a web-based application that allows users to create, take, and share quizzes. With this platform, users can:

Create Quizzes: Users can easily create their own quizzes by adding questions, answers, and other relevant information.
Browse Quizzes: Users can browse through a collection of available quizzes created by other users and participate in them.
Take Quizzes: Users can take quizzes and receive immediate feedback on their performance, including their final score.
Share Quizzes: Users can share the quizzes they've created with others, allowing for collaborative learning and assessment.
The project is built using modern web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it provides a user-friendly interface for a seamless quiz-taking experience.

This project was developed as a part of my portfolio to showcase my web development skills and the ability to create a functional and engaging quiz platform.

# Technologies Used
Python Django: The project backend is built using the Python-based Django web framework, which provides a powerful and flexible platform for developing web applications.
HTML: The front-end user interface is constructed using HTML, the standard markup language for creating web pages.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to control the presentation and styling of the web pages, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive user experience.
JavaScript: JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web pages, such as handling user interactions, validating form inputs, and updating the UI in real-time.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or even contribute to the project's development. Enjoy!
