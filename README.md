# quiz-platform
The Quiz Platform is a web-based application that allows users to create, take, and share quizzes. With this platform, users can:

Create Quizzes: Users can easily create their own quizzes by adding questions, answers, and other relevant information.
Browse Quizzes: Users can browse through a collection of available quizzes created by other users and participate in them.
Take Quizzes: Users can take quizzes and receive immediate feedback on their performance, including their final score.
Share Quizzes: Users can share the quizzes they've created with others, allowing for collaborative learning and assessment.
The project is built using modern web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it provides a user-friendly interface for a seamless quiz-taking experience.

This project was developed as a part of my portfolio to showcase my web development skills and the ability to create a functional and engaging quiz platform.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or even contribute to the project's development. Enjoy!
